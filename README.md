# DAH (Domain Authentication Hardening)
Domain Authentication Hardening script (DAH) is a powershell script to assist sysadmins in implementing security measures in the Kerberos authentication process in regards to domain authentication. 
This works by using domain policies via Group Policy Objects (GPO) to implement policies that enforce several hardening policies to secure the Kerberos authentication process. 
This powershell script also provides a feature to check your current policies in regards to secure policy implementations, similar to an audit.

This should be run on your domain controller as the administrator account.
